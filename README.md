# 🎨 Wordoodle

Welcome to Wordoodle, the real-time collaborative drawing game where creativity knows no bounds! Gather your friends and let the fun begin as you embark on an artistic adventure together. With Wordoodle, there's no need for login or signup – just jump right in and unleash your imagination!

## How to Play 🚀

### Setup 🎮
Gather a group of players and designate one person as the “drawer” for each round.

### Prompt 🖌️
Choose a prompt or phrase for the current round. Let your creativity flow – anything from simple objects like “cat” or “house” to adventurous themes like “outer space exploration” or “underwater kingdom”!

### Drawing ✏️
The drawer has a limited amount of time (usually a minute or two) to sketch their interpretation of the prompt. Use any drawing tools available – pen and paper, digital drawing app, or even a whiteboard!

### Guessing 🤔
While the drawer is sketching, the other players try to guess what the drawing represents. Shout out your guesses or write them down privately – every idea counts!

### Winner 🏆
The player who correctly guesses the prompt earns a point. Alternatively, points can be awarded to the drawer if someone guesses correctly within a certain time limit.

### Rotation 🔄
Rotate the role of the drawer to the next player, and repeat the process with a new prompt.

### End Game 🎉
Continue the fun for as many rounds as you desire, with players accumulating points. The player with the most points at the end is declared the ultimate Wordoodle champion!
